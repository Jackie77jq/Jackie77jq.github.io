[professional bio]

## Research Interests
- [Interest 1:Develop a machine learning model that can predict cloudburst occurrence, aiming to predict within a 6-hour window]
- [Interest 2:Estimate intensity and potential impact]
- [Interest 3:Achieve prediction accuracy better than current 50% rates in target locations]

## QMSS Practicum Project
[The project aims to develop a prototype predictive software system for early warning of cloudbursts in urban areas. The system will analyze multiple data sources to predict the frequency and intensity of  cloudbursts within a 6-hour window, helping improve disaster preparedness for residents and businesses.]
